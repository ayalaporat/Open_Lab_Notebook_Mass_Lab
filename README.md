to each bottle: 
1.	Spin down
2.	add ddw according to manifacutrs' instractions.
3.	wartecs+spin down.
4.	in eight new marked tubes add 90 µl of ddw to 10 µl of primer. 

DNA extraction: For each alga, 2 grams of powder alga were added into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 750µL acidic water (pH 4). The tubes were centrifuged at 7500 rpm at room temperature for 2 minutes to wash off the polysaccharides covering the algae. After decantation of the supernatant this procedure was repeated. 100 µL of buffer (25nM NaOH/0.2mM EDTA) were added to the washed algae powder and the mixture was centrifuged. After decantation, the tubes were dipped in liquid nitrogen for 30 seconds and transferred for into a heating block 10 minutes, pre-heated to 99°C. The tubes were then cooled to room temperature and 100 µL of buffer (40 mM tris HCl pH 5.5) were added. Finally, the tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes. At this stage, the DNA was present in the supernatant, which was transferred into new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. 1:100 dilutions of the produced DNA were made to be used in the gene amplifications process
